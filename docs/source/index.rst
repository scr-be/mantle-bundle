Overview
========

The Scribe Symfony Foundation is an MIT licensed internal dependency used by
Scribe Inc for our public and internal website applications as well as our client
web projects.

In addition to Symfony, this package also includes a collection of
additional Symfony bundles, Doctrine, Assetic, PHPOption, and a collection of
Sensio dependencies. You'll notice our composer.json isn't vastly different from
a standard Symfony install. lso included is a library of the base exceptions,
abstract components, new Response types, and a large assortment of generally
statically called utility methods.

In addition, we maintain a collection of packages that are marked as suggested
installs that range from a Stripe API library (that interfaces with the moble
payment website and allows basic operations) to a Swim library (that is our own
personal extension of Markdown).
